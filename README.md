#Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to identify and analyze the pivotal factors influencing the approval of H1-B visas, despite the lottery-based system. Additionally, it aims to construct a machine learning prediction model capable of estimating the likelihood of an individual obtaining an H1-B visa. Utilizing data extracted from the USCIS portal spanning 2017 to 2022, the analysis delves into 3.5 million observations across 13 attributes.

#Key findings
1. Although the H-1B visa system operates on a lottery basis, our analysis reveals significant factors that impact the prediction of an individual's visa approval.
2. Key determinants such as employer, SOC title, job title, work state, and wage category emerged as influential factors in predicting H-1B visa certification or denial.
3. Addressing our business objective of identifying external factors affecting H-1B visa certification or denial, our analysis underscores the role of various factors in influencing visa outcomes. For instance, our findings suggest that a software engineer at Cognizant, based in California, with a high-income wage, stands a higher chance of H-1B visa approval. Conversely, an analyst at NTT Data, based in Alabama, with a low-income wage, faces lower odds of H-1B visa approval.
